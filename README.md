# Fashion-Recommonder-Deep-Learning

**Overview Of the Project**

With an increase in the standard of living, people's attention gradually moved towards fashion that is concerned to be a popular aesthetic expression. Humans are inevitably drawn towards something that is visually more attractive. This tendency of humans has led to the development of the fashion industry over the course of time. However, given too many options of garments on the e-commerce websites, has presented new challenges to the customers in identifying their correct outfit. Thus, in this project, we proposed a personalized Fashion Recommender system that generates recommendations for the user based on an input given. Unlike the conventional systems that rely on the user's previous purchases and history, this project aims at using an image of a product given as input by the user to generate recommendations since many-a-time people see something that they are interested in and tend to look for products that are similar to that.

**Algorithm Used**

1. **RestNet50** : ResNet-50 is a convolutional neural network that is 50 layers deep. It is pre Trained model which is trained on Image Net dataset.
 
2. **Convolutional Neural Network** : A Convolutional Neural Network is a deep Learning algorithm which can take in an input assign importance to various aspects in the image  and be able to differentiate one form the other .

3. **k-nearest neighbors** : KNN algorithm is one of the simplest classification algorithm and it is one of the most used learning algorithms. Its purpose is to use a database in which tha data points are seperated into several classes to predict the classification of a new sample point.
